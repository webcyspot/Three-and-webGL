		<p>
			three.js is a JavaScript-based library.
		</p>
			However, it's possible to use three.js in a TypeScript project, as the library
			exposes [link:https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/introduction.html TypeScript declaration files] (*.d.ts* files) making it usable in TypeScript projects.

		<p>
			A minimal configuration is required for the TypeScript compiler to
			discover three.js types.<br>
			You will need to set the [link:https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/module-resolution.html moduleResolution]
			option to *node*, and the [link:https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options.html target] to *es6* or newer.
		</p>

		<code>
		// Example of minimal `tsconfig.json` file
		{
			"compilerOptions": {
				"target": "es6",
				"moduleResolution": "node",
			},
			"include": [ "./src/**/*.ts" ],
		}
		</code>

		<p>
			As of today, it's not yet possible to three.js in a TypeScript project
			without using the [link:https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/module-resolution.html node module resolution algorithm].
		</p>

		<p>
			Note: It happens that some declarations are incorrect and/or missing.
			Contributing to Types Declaration Files is really helpful for the community, making three.js
			typings better and more accurate.
