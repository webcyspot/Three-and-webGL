			The following is a collection of links that you might find useful when learning Three.<br />
			If you find something that you'd like to add here, or think that one of the links below is no longer
			relevant or working, feel free to click the 'edit' button in the top right and make some changes!<br /><br />

			Note also that as three.js is under rapid development, a lot of these links will contain information that is
			out of date - if something isn't working as you'd expect or one of these links says it should,
			check the browser console for warning, the relevant docs pages and especially the [page:DeprecatedList].

    <h2>Presentations</h2>

		<h3>[link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dir4KO9RdhM AlterQualia at WebGL Camp 3]</h3>
		<div>
			A video presentation from 2012 by AlteredQualia, one of the main developers of three.js.

		<h2>Examples</h2>

		<h3>[link:http://stemkoski.github.io/Three.js/index.html Professor Stemkoskis Examples]</h3>
		<div>
			Even though Dr. Lee Stemkoski's examples are built using r60, they are very beginner
			friendly and contain a lot of useful info.
			Just be warned that some of them might be a bit out of date now!
		</div>

		<h3>[link:http://yomotsu.github.io/threejs-examples/ Yomotsus Examples]</h3>
		<div>
			Again, these are built with an old version of three.js (r49), so the same warnings as above apply:
			be warned that you might have to make some changes to use the techniques in these examples.
	 </div>

	 <h3>[link:https://threejs.org/examples/ Official three.js Examples]</h3>
	 <div>
		 A large number of examples are maintained as part of the three.js repository. They are kept up to
		 date and always use the latest version.
	   It's probably best to work off these examples than the ones linked above, however some of them may
		 not be quite as beginner friendly.
	 </div>

	 <h3>[link:https://rawgit.com/mrdoob/three.js/dev/examples/ Official three.js Examples] (dev branch) </h3>
	 <div>
		 Same as the above, except these use the dev branch of three.js,
		 and are used to check that everything is working as three.js being is developed.
