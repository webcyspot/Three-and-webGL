their licenses.


1. Vocaloid stuffs

You are allowed to use Crypton's Vocaloid(Hatsune Miku, Kagamine Rin, and so on)
stuffs (MMD models, songs, and so on) only if you follow the guideline set by
Crypton Future Media, INC. for the usage of its characters.

For detail, see http://piapro.net/en_for_creators.html


2. MMD stuffs

In MMD, there is no unified license. If you want to use MMD works (models,
songs, dances, and so on), read readme included in archive file and follow the
license the author set.

If the works are fan works, you must follow the original work's license. (For
example, you also need to follow the license set by Crypton, not only the
license the author set, to use a Miku MMD model)

For your information, generally MMD works are very restricted to use.

Most MMD works are NOT allowed for
- redistribution
- porn use
- commercial use
- etc.

Think that what is not written in readme is not allowed.
